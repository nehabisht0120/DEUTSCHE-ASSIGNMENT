            <li>Above displayed is the stomp data driven table </li>
            <li>So here goes the approach:
                <p>1. so for every unique stomp update a new row was added in the table</p>
                <p>2. for every new update the present row data was updated accordingly</p>
                <p>3. and sparklines were created by calculating mid prices of the last recent 30 entries , Assumption was every
                    update was received with lag of 1 second </p>
                <p> 4. After all the operations were done the table was sorted by "last changed bid" amount</p>
            </li>
            <li>Jest testing framework has been used for writing unit tests
            </li>
        </ul>
